Markdown notes - WOODHOUSE 

Hi there,
This is my first Markdown note. So far I quite like GitHub as a version control system and I'm understanding the basics of it.
I also created my first **respiratory**. I also played around with creating some **branches, pull requests, commits and merging two or more 
commits into one**.
